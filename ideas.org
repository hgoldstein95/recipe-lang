* Things to Keep in Mind
  - Some actions change the identifier: =coat chicken with flour=
  - Some actions move the identifier: =place chicken in dish=
  - Prepositions should be interchangable: =place chicken in dish= vs =place
    chicken on plate=
  - Every command should have optional expository parameter
  - Identifier hiding should be possible: =in_bowl flour { add flour. }.=

* Questions
  - Should =in_bowl= be special, or generalized out?
  - How should we handle ingredient amounts?
  - Can flexibility be added beyond the expository parameter?
